# 🏗️ Architecture.md

**Content Review & Approval System**

---

# 1. 📌 Overview

This application is a **workflow-driven content management system** that enables:

* Content creation
* Multi-stage approval workflow
* Rejection → edit → re-submission cycle
* Final approval → locked & optionally published content

The system is designed with **clear separation of concerns**, **RBAC**, and **state-driven workflow transitions**.

---

# 2. ⚙️ Tech Stack

## Frontend

* React (Vite + TypeScript)
* Tailwind CSS v4
* React Router
* React Context API (state management)
* React Hot Toast (notifications)
* Optional: ShadCN UI (for components)

---

## Backend

* Node.js + Express.js (TypeScript)
* PostgreSQL
* Drizzle ORM
* Zod (validation)
* Cookie-based authentication (Simple)

---

## Architecture Style

* Modular Monolith
* Layered architecture:

  * Controllers
  * Services
  * Routes
  * Database

---

# 3. 👥 Roles & Access Control (RBAC)

### Roles:

* `CREATOR`
* `REVIEWER_L1`
* `REVIEWER_L2`

### Responsibility:

| Role             | Responsibility                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Creator          | Create, edit (after rejection), submit |
| Reviewer L1      | Approve/reject stage 1                 |
| Reviewer L2      | Approve/reject stage 2                 |

---

# 4. 🔄 Workflow Design

## Content Lifecycle

```txt
DRAFT → IN_REVIEW (Stage 1) → IN_REVIEW (Stage 2) → APPROVED
                  ↓
           CHANGES_REQUESTED → EDIT → RESUBMIT → Stage 1
```

---

## Rules

* Content starts as `DRAFT`
* Submission moves content to **Stage 1**
* Each stage requires approval by correct reviewer
* Rejection:

  * moves to `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
  * unlocks content
  * resets stage
* Editing allowed only after rejection
* Approved content:

  * becomes **locked**
  * cannot be edited

---

# 10. 🔌 API Design (High-Level)

## Content

* `POST /content`
* `GET /content`
* `GET /content/:id`
* `PUT /content/:id`

---

## Workflow

* `POST /content/:id/submit`
* `POST /content/:id/approve`
* `POST /content/:id/reject`

---

# 11. ⚠️ Key Constraints

* No skipping workflow stages
* No editing after approval
* Only correct reviewer can approve stage
* Rejection resets workflow

---

# 13. 🧾 Design Philosophy

This system is designed as a:

```txt
State Machine + RBAC + Relational Data Model
```

Key principles:

* Strong data integrity
* Explicit workflow transitions
* Separation of concerns
* Scalable architecture

---

# ✅ Summary

This architecture ensures:

* Clean workflow enforcement
* Scalable backend design
* Maintainable frontend structure
* Strong alignment with real-world CMS systems
